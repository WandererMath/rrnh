To quickly build the project,

git clone
cd src

(1) Analyzing RNA-seq data 

Change the first line of Makefile to:
DIR_DATA=../data07

DESeq2 Analysis:
make deseq2

Make Venn Diagram:
make venn

Make scatter plots:
make scatter

(2) Analyzing Ribo-Seq data:
Change the first line of Makefile to:
DIR_DATA=../data08

Follow the same steps as (1):
make deseq2
make venn
make scatter

Next, TE analysis:
Create a python2 enviroment and then install RiboDiff.
Activate the environment, type:
which python
to know the python2 path. Then change the 2nd line of Makefile to:
PYTHON2=[your python2 path] 
Then deactivate python2 environment and activate python3 environment. Run:
make rdiff

Make Venn Diagram for TE:
make ribo-venn
