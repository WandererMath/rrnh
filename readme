To quickly build the project,

git clone
cd src

(1) Analyzing RNA-seq data 

Change the first line of Makefile to:
DIR_DATA=../data07

DESeq2 Analysis:
make deseq2

Make Venn Diagram:
make venn

Make scatter plots:
make scatter

(2) Analyzing Ribo-Seq data:
Change the first line of Makefile to:
DIR_DATA=../data08

Follow the same steps as (1):
make deseq2
make venn
make scatter

Next, TE analysis:
Create a python2 enviroment and then install RiboDiff (refer to ribo-diff.yml for dependency installations, which is exported from my environment that works).
Activate the environment, type:
which python
to know the python2 path. Then change the 2nd line of Makefile to:
PYTHON2=[your python2 path] 
Then deactivate python2 environment and activate python3 environment. Run:
make rdiff

Make Venn Diagram for TE:
make ribo-venn

DAVID GO Analysis:
You can find .symbol files in venn and ribo-venn directories. In ribo-venn:
P.txt: Bp-Cp  == TE Reduced by rrnH
M.txt: Bm-Cm == TE Stimulated by rrnH
(p means plus, m means minus)

Select Identifier: OFFICIAL_GENE_SYMBOL
Select Species: Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

All procedures

Part 1: From raw data to featureCounts
Recommend doing this part on supercomputer with parallelism.

- src_raw

sbatch ...sh

May need minor adjustment on relative paths. The .sh files can be automatically generated by the python scripts.


Part 2: From featureCounts to main results
Describe above.


Part 3: Other analysis

- speicial_rrna
- regulon
- asd
